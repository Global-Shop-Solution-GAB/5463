For the program to work, a TraceSummary will need to be generated through the 'TraceParser' function in System Info.
Once the file is generated, it needs to be moved to the GLOBAL\TEMP folder.
The program will read the TraceSummary and move the Global Shop Files, that are referenced in the TraceSummary, into a folder in GLOBAL\TEMP. It will then zip the folder and delete the un-zipped version of the folder.
